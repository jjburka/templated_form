TemplatedForm
=============

Plugin based on various form examples I have ran across. 
I do not claim to have the copyright or authorship for that code

Example
=======

When installed creates the following helper methods: 
  templated_form_for, templated_fields_for, templated_form_remote_for, 
  templated_remote_form_for
  
The fields inside the above blocks will be rendered using the partials found in
the views/forms directory

_field.html.erb

Overrides the label/field pair in normal conditions

_field_with_errors.html.erb

Overrides under error condition
